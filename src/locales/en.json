    "faq": {
      "q1": "What kind of games do you make?",
      "a1": "We create 2D action-driven games with a strong emphasis on storytelling and original worlds. Our projects range from semi-open world adventures to linear, narrative-focused experiences, as well as hybrid designs that combine action combat with systems like tower defense.",
      "q2": "Why do you use RPG Maker?",
      "a2": "RPG Maker is a powerful tool when used to its full potential. We build custom systems, fast-paced action combat, and unique mechanics that go far beyond traditional turn-based RPGs, while remaining efficient and flexible as a small studio.",
      "q3": "Are your games turn-based RPGs?",
      "a3": "No. Our games are primarily real-time action-based, including hack-and-slash and action battle systems. Each project is designed around the experience it needs—not a fixed formula.",
      "q4": "Why are your games priced so low?",
      "a4": "Our pricing reflects our development philosophy, not our quality. By keeping production efficient, we offer complete, polished games at accessible prices—typically between $1 and $3.",
      "q5": "Does low price mean short or low-quality games?",
      "a5": "No. Most of our games offer at least 3 hours of gameplay. We apply high standards in design, polish, and testing, treating every project with care.",
      "q6": "Do you use asset packs or original assets?",
      "a6": "We use a combination of community resources, licensed asset packs, and original content, always respecting creators and licenses. Assets are carefully integrated to fit each game's identity.",
      "q7": "Are your games connected to each other?",
      "a7": "Some may share themes or universes, while others are standalone. Each game is designed to be enjoyable on its own without prior knowledge of our other projects.",
      "q8": "What platforms do you develop for?",
      "a8": "We primarily focus on PC platforms. Specific platform information is always provided on each game's individual page.",
      "q9": "How do you approach quality and testing?",
      "a9": "We develop with an AAA mindset at a small scale—iterative design, internal testing, careful balancing, and polishing until the experience feels right.",
      "q10": "Do you plan to expand beyond RPG Maker?",
      "a10": "We're open to new tools if they help deliver better experiences. However, our focus remains on making great games—the tool is a means, not the goal."
